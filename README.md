Title: Stacks in a ListView/"New Month Generator" (2/27/23-4/7/23)
This is an assignment for my high school advanced java class.  I used two string stacks to display 75 "new months" (the traditional 12 months led by a random first letter) in a listView.  This assignment built off of a previous one in which I was tasked to research a linear data structure.  Because I chose to research binary search trees in the previous assignment, I chose to learn how to implement another linear structure.  This assignment required that I implemented the stacks (with proper declaration and population) and showcased data overflow (scrolling in the listView).
